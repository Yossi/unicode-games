Most, but not all, of these games use unicode so you will need a good terminal program. Good luck finding one.

## Chess
 This only sets up and displays a chess board. Actually making it useable and eventually playable against is left as an exercise for the reader (ie. I never got around to it)
## Dominos
 This one works and even has an AI but it just picks a random tile that fits to play.
 The game here is a [Blocking Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes#Blocking_game)
## FlipEm (Lights Out)
 A LightsOut game where you toggle the cells around you in a + shape. *Does not use unicode.*
## Pong
 Not playable. Half baked demo to see what pong would look like if played on one line.
## TicTacToe
 What it says on the tin. *Does not use unicode.*
